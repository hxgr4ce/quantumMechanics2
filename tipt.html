            <h1>Time-Independent Perturbation Theory</h1>
            <h2>Motivating Perturbation Theory</h2>
            Last semester, we saw that you can solve for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian in a few <i>very specific</i> idealized cases. 
            It is actually not very common at all to be able to do so in realistic cases.
            For example, sometimes the associated Hilbert space has billions or even trillions of dimensions, so solving \(\hat H|\psi_n\rangle=E|\psi_n\rangle\) is near impossible to sove.
            In some of these cases, we turn to perturbation theory.
            <br><br>
            Essentially, we can describe a certain Hamiltonian as an idealized/model Hamiltonian <i>plus some perturbation</i>:
            \[\hat H = \hat H_0 + \lambda\hat V, \lambda \in [0,1]\]
            where \(\hat H_0\) is the model Hamiltonian, \(\lambda\hat V\) is the perturbation, and \(\lambda\) is a scaling factor that is often slowly increased from 0 to 1 so that we can see the transition from \(\hat H_0\) to \(\hat H\).
            <br><br>
            We can then solve \(\hat H(\lambda)|\psi_n(\lambda)\rangle=E(\lambda)|\psi_n(\lambda)\rangle\), knowing that \(\hat H_0|\psi^{(0)}\rangle_n=E^{(0)}_n|\psi^{(0)}_n\rangle\).
            Of course, we should have already solved the idealized cases, so we should know \(|\psi^{(0)}_n\rangle\) and \(E^{(0)}_n\) from the outset.
            <br><br>
            In both of the methods described below, we choose a "reference" eigenstate of the model Hamiltonian, \(|\varphi_0\rangle\) which has eignevalue \(E^{(0)}_n\) so that:
            \[\lim_{\lambda\to 0}|\psi_n(\lambda)\rangle = |\varphi_0\rangle \text{ and } \lim_{\lambda\to 0}E_n(\lambda) = E^{(0)}_n\]
            Our ultimate goal is to solve for the eigenstates and eigenfunctions of the perturbed Hamiltonian, \(|\psi_n(\lambda)\rangle\) and \(E_n(\lambda)\) as expansions in powers of \(\lambda\).
            
            <h2>The Brillouin-Wigner Perturbation Theory</h2>
            This method is simpler, but is not <i>size consistent</i>, meaning that \(E^{[N]}_{A+B} \neq E^{[N]}_A + E^{[N]}_B\).
            This means that we are unable to model two independent systems that are, over time, gradually brought close enough to interact.
            <br><br>
            The non-degenerate case begins as follows.
            Say that the unperturbed Hamiltonian behaves as:
            \[\hat H_0|\varphi_n\rangle = E^{(0)}_n|\varphi_n\rangle, \langle\varphi_n|\varphi_m\rangle = \delta_{nm}\]
            and that our reference eigenstate is  \(|\varphi_0\rangle\).
            We introduce a projector \(\hat P\) which projects into the eigenspace of our reference eigenstate, so \(\hat P \equiv |\varphi_0\rangle\langle\varphi_0|\), and \(\hat P\)'s orthogonal complement, \(\hat Q = \hat 1 - \hat P = \sum_{n\neq0}|\varphi_n\rangle\langle\varphi_n|\).
            <br><br>
            Note that in Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory, we assume that \(\lambda=1\), so we write perturbed eigenstate \(|\psi_n(\lambda)\) as simply \(|\psi_n\rangle\) or even just \(|\psi\rangle\).
            <br><br>
            Now, for arbitrary orthonormal eigenstate \(|\psi\rangle\) of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we choose an <i>intermediate normalization</i> \(\langle\varphi_0|\psi\rangle = 1\).
            This applies to all eigenstates (except one?), since they are all orthonormal.
            We can then see the following:
            \[(\hat H_0 + \hat V)|\psi\rangle = E|\psi\rangle\]
            \[\hat P|\psi\rangle = |\varphi_0\rangle\langle\varphi_0|\psi\rangle = |\varphi_0\rangle\]
            and, by nature of the projectors we defined,
            \[\hat 1 = \hat Q + \hat P\]
            \[|\psi\rangle = (\hat Q + \hat P)|\psi\rangle = \hat Q|\psi\rangle + |\varphi_0\rangle\]
            all that is left for us to do to find an expansion for perturbed eigenstate \(|\psi\rangle\) is to find an expression for \(\hat Q|\psi\rangle\).
