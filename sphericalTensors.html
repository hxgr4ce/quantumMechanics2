            <h1>Spherical Tensors</h1>
            <h2>What are Tensors?</h2>
            A tensor is simply a description of the relationships between "algebraic objects" in a vector space.
            The simplest examples of tensors are vectors and scalars, but maps between vector spaces and operations like the dot product are also tensors.
            <br><br>
            From a computer science background, I prefer to think about tensors as arrays, where the rank is related to the dimension, or the number of indices needed to locate a single element in the tensor:
            <br>
            A tensor of rank 0 is a scalar, which makes sense, because a scalar is a single value; you don't need any index to locate an element within a scalar "object".
            <br>
            A tensor of rank 1 is a vector, which also makes sense because a vector can be though of as a 1D array, and you need a single index to locate an element in a vector.
            <br>
            A tensor of rank 2 is matrix; you can think of a matrix as a 2D array, where you need to specify two indices, the row and column, to locate a specific element.
            <br>
            I'm not sure if higher order tensors have names... but you get the idea.
            <br><br>
            We typically write \(T_{ijk\cdots}\) to describe a tensor, where the number of indices is the <b><i>rank</i></b> of the tensor, a.k.a. the number of indices needed to locate an element in the tensor.
            E.g. \(T_i\) is a vector, \(T_{ij}\) is a matrix, and so on.
            <br><br>
            You can also think of tensors as elements in the vector space created by the <a href="tensorProducts.html">tensor products</a> between other vector spaces.
            This definition is related to the definition of tensors as maps between vector spaces; all bilinear maps \(T: V\times V \to \mathbb R, T \in V^* \otimes V^*\) are tensors, including the dot product.
            But that's all I know about that.
            <br><br>
            The elements of a tensor follow very specific transformation rules under rotation, which we will see later.
            You can define a tensor using these transformation laws, which we will discuss later on this page.

            <h2>Cartesian Tensors</h2>
            Tensors are not tied to any basis, but we can use orthonormal bases in Euclidean/Cartesian space to represent a tensor.
            A tensor can be broken down into components along these bases.
            <br><br>
            A rotation \(R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\) (see <a href="euler.html">Euler rotations</a>) can be separated into three rotations: \(R_z(\alpha)R_y(\beta)R_z(\gamma)\).
            <br><br>
            Each of these three rotations can be represented as matrix, for example, a rotation about the \(\hat z\)-axis by an angle \(\alpha\) is:
            \[
                \pmatrix{
                    \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha & 0 \\
                    \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha & 0 \\
                    0 & 0 & 1
                }
            \]
            since this type of rotation takes the \(\hat x\)-axis to \(\hat x' = \hat x\cos\alpha - y\sin\alpha\) and the \(\hat y\)-axis to \(\hat y' = \hat x\sin\alpha + \hat y\cos\alpha\).
            Simple matrix multiplication between the rotation matrices for \(R_z(\alpha)\), \(R_y(\beta)\), and \(R_z(\gamma)\) yields the rotation matrix for the total rotation, with elements \(R_{ij}\).
            <br><br>
            Say that we have a vector \(\vec V\) that has elements \(V_i\).
            Under rotation \(R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\), elements of \(\vec V\) transform as \(V_i \to \sum_j R_{ij}V_j\) (similar to <a href="wigner.html">Wigner D-Matrices</a>?).
            <br><br>
            We can generalize this transformation under rotation to obtain the definition of a tensor \(T_{ijk\cdots}\):
            \[T_{ijk\cdots} \to \sum_{i'}\sum_{j'}\sum_{k'}\cdots R_{ii'}R_{jj'}R_{kk'}\cdots T_{i'j'k'\cdots}\]
            A tensor that transforms this way under rotation is called a Cartesian Tensor.
            <br><br>
            The simplest example of a Cartesian Tensor of rank 2, for example, is formed from two vectors, say \(\vec U\) and \(\vec V\), so that \(T_{ij} = U_iV_j\).
            That's it.
            Under rotation, we produce a \(T_{ij}' = U_i'V_j' = \sum_{ln} R_{il} R_{jn}U_l V_n\).

            <h2>Cartesian to Spherical</h2>
            Cartesian coordinates are <i>reducible</i>, meaning that they can be decomposed into objects that can transform differently from each other under rotations.
            We want to write tensors as a single object that transforms in one single way under rotation.
            It turns out that to do this, we can reduce Cartesian tensors into spherical tensors.
            <br><br>
            A spherical tensor is parameterized by rank \(k\) and magnetic quantum number \(q\), and is defined by spherical harmonics (special functions defined on the surface of a sphere) and a vector \(\vec V\).
            Spherical harmonics are described by angular momentum \(l\) and magnetic quantum number \(m\), and take some argument \(\hat n\) to describe the orientation of the spherical harmonic.
            Essentially:
            \[T^{(k)}_q = Y_{l=k, m=q}(\vec V)\]
            But how do we actually convert from Cartesian tensors to spherical tensors?
            The Cartesian components along the \(x, y,\) and \(z\) axes can be written in terms of spherical <i>coordinates</i>.
            We can write \(x = r\sin\theta\cos\phi\), \(y = r\sin\theta\sin\phi\), and \(z=r\cos\theta\).
            <br><br>
            As a result, the spherical harmonics, which are typically written in spherical coordinates, can be written in terms of Cartesian coordinates, and Cartesian coordinates can be written in terms of spherical harmonics.
            For example:
            \[\begin{align}
                Y_{1\pm1}(\hat r) &= \mp\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}}\sin\theta e^{\pm i\phi} \\
                &= \mp\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}}\sin\theta (\cos\phi\pm i\sin\phi) \\
                &= \mp\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}}(\sin\theta\cos\phi \pm i\sin\theta\sin\phi) \\
                &= \mp\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}}\frac{1}{r}(r\sin\theta\cos\phi \pm ir\sin\theta\sin\phi) \\
                &= \mp\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}}\frac{(x\pm iy)}{r}
            \end{align}\]
            (note that the distance \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\) is invariant under rotation, and so is a scalar)
            \[\begin{align}
                Y_{10}(\hat r) &= \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\cos\theta \\
                &= \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\frac{z}{r}
            \end{align}\]
            These relationships: \(Y_{1\pm1}(\hat r)= \mp\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}}\frac{(x\pm iy)}{r}\) and \(Y_{10}(\hat r) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\frac{z}{r}\) can be applied to spherical tensors with rank 1 (since in that case, \(l=k=1\)).
            \[\begin{align}
                T^{(1)}_q &= Y_{1q}(\vec V) \\
                T^{(1)}_1 &= Y_{11}(\vec V) = -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}}\frac{(V_x + iV_y)}{||\vec V ||}\\
                T^{(1)}_{-1} &= Y_{11}(\vec V) = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}}\frac{(V_x - iV_y)}{||\vec V ||}\\
                T^{(1)}_{0} &= Y_{10}(\vec V) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\frac{V_z}{||\vec V||}
            \end{align}\]
            but, after some sort of finagling of the phase conventions which I do not really understand, we typically have:
            \[\begin{align}
                T^{(1)}_{\pm 1} &= \mp\frac{(V_x \pm iV_y)}{\sqrt 2}\\
                T^{(1)}_{0} &= V_z
            \end{align}\]
            Thus we can build a spherical tensor using components of a Cartesian tensor.

            <h2>Finally Spherical Tensors</h2>
            We now look into the properties and definitions of spherical tensors.
            <br><br>
            <b><i>Transformation under rotation.</i></b> 
            Spherical harmonic \(Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi) = \langle \hat r|lm\rangle\) by definition.
            A rotation of spherical tensor \(|lm\rangle\) would look like:
            \[
                \hat R|lm\rangle = \sum_{m'}|lm'\rangle\langle lm'|\hat R|lm\rangle = \sum_{m'}|lm'\rangle D^{l}_{m'm}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) \tag{1}
            \]
            where the space of all \(|lm\rangle\) for a \((2l+1)\)-dimensional subspace that is invariant under rotation.
            For example, for spherical tensor \(A_{1\mu}\) with rank 1: 
            \[\hat R(A_{1\mu}) = \sum_{m'}A_{1\mu'}D^l_{\mu'\mu}(\hat R)\]
            <b>By definition, all spherical tensors transform this way under rotation</b>.
            <br><br>
            Say that \(\hat T_\mu^k\) with rank \(k\) and projection \(\mu = -k. -k + 1,\cdots,k-1, k\) is a family of operators.
            This is how an <b>object</b> with angular momentum \(J\) transforms under rotation:
            \[
                \hat R|\psi_{JM}\rangle = \sum_{m'}|\psi_{JM'}\rangle D^{(J)}_{M'M}
            \]
            What about \(\hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu|\psi_{JM}\rangle)\)?
            \[\begin{align}
                \hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu|\psi_{JM}\rangle) &= \hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu) \hat R|\psi_{JM}\rangle \\
                &\text{and} \\
                \hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu|\psi_{JM}\rangle) &= \hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu) \hat R^{-1}\hat R|\psi_{JM}\rangle \\
                &\text{so} \\
                 \hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu) &= \hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu) \hat R^{-1}
            \end{align}\]
            This is how <b>operators</b> transform under rotation.
            <b>If</b> \(\hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu)\) fits the form of (1) so that:
            \[
                 \hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu) \hat R^{-1} = \sum_{\mu'}\hat T^{(k)}_{\mu'}D^{(k)}_{\mu'\mu}(\hat R)
            \]
            <b>then</b> \(\{\hat T^{(k)}_\mu\}\) is a spherical tensor of rank \(k\).
            <br><br>
            <b><i id="commut">Generic commutation relations.</i></b>
            We've seen in the <a href="amt.html">past</a> that \([\hat J_i, \hat A_j] = i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}A_k\) for vectors/tensors of rank 1 operators \(\hat {\vec A}\).
            We've also seen that \([\hat J_i, \hat S]=0\) for all scalars/tensors of rank 0 \(\hat S\).
            We can generalize these commutation relations to apply to tensors of any rank.
            <br><br>
            Using Stone's theorem:
            \[\hat R = e^{-i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar}\]
            so
            \[\begin{align}
                \hat R(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu) \hat R^{-1} &= \left ( e^{-i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar} \right ) \hat T^{(k)}_\mu \left (e^{i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar} \right ) 
                = \sum_{\mu'}\hat T^{(k)}_{\mu'}\langle k\mu'|e^{-i\phi \hat n\cdot \hat{\vec J}/\hbar}|k\mu\rangle \\
            \end{align}\]
            If we pick \(\phi \ll 1\) and expand to \(o(\phi^2)\):
            \[\begin{align}
                \left ( e^{-i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar} \right ) \hat T^{(k)}_\mu \left (e^{i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar} \right ) 
                &= (\hat 1 - i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar)\hat T^{(k)}_\mu(\hat 1 + i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar) \\
                &= \hat T^{(k)}_\mu - i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar\hat T^{(k)}_\mu + \hat T^{(k)}_\mu i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar  - i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar \hat T^{(k)}_\mu  i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar \\
                &= \hat T^{(k)}_\mu + [- i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar, \hat T^{(k)}_\mu] + o(\phi^2) \\
                &= \hat T^{(k)}_\mu - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar} [\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}, \hat T^{(k)}_\mu] + o(\phi^2) \\
                &\text{and} \\
                \sum_{\mu'}\hat T^{(k)}_{\mu'}\langle k\mu'|e^{-i\phi \hat n\cdot \hat{\vec J}/\hbar}|k\mu\rangle
                &= \sum_{\mu'}\hat T^{(k)}_\mu\left(\langle k\mu'|\hat 1-i\phi\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}/\hbar|k\mu\rangle\right ) \\
                &= \sum_{\mu'}\hat T_{k\mu}\left ( \langle k\mu'|\hat 1|k\mu\rangle - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar}\langle k\mu'|\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}|k\mu\rangle \right ) \\
                &= \sum_{\mu'}\hat T_{k\mu}\delta_{\mu\mu'} - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar}\hat T_{k\mu}\langle k\mu'|\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}|k\mu\rangle \\
                &= \hat T_{k\mu} - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar} \sum_{\mu'}\hat T_{k\mu}\langle k\mu'|\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}|k\mu\rangle \\
                &\text{so:} \\
                \hat T^{(k)}_\mu - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar} [\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}, \hat T^{(k)}_\mu] + o(\phi^2) 
                &=
                \hat T_{k\mu} - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar} \sum_{\mu'}\hat T_{k\mu}\langle k\mu'|\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}|k\mu\rangle \\
                [\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}, \hat T^{(k)}_\mu]
                &=
                \sum_{\mu'}\hat T_{k\mu}\langle k\mu'|\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}|k\mu\rangle \\
            \end{align}\]
            Our \(\hat n\) can be \(\hat x, \hat y, \hat z\), so we can make \(\hat n\cdot\hat{\vec J}\) into \(\hat J_x, \hat J_y, \hat J_z\), and by extension we can also find the commutators with \(\hat J_\pm\).
            \[[\hat J_z, \hat T^{(k)}_\mu] = \sum_{\mu'}\hat T_{k\mu}\langle k\mu'|\hat J_z|k\mu\rangle = \sum_{\mu'}\hat T_{k\mu}\langle k\mu'|\hbar\mu|k\mu\rangle = \hbar\mu\hat T^{(k)}_\mu \]
            \[[\hat J_\pm, \hat T^{(k)}_\mu] = \sum_{\mu'}\hat T_{k\mu}\langle k\mu'|\hat J_\pm|k\mu\rangle = \hbar\sqrt{k(k+1)-\mu(\mu\pm1)}\hat T^{(k)}_{\mu\pm 1}\]
            <b>Any \(\{\hat T^{(k)}_\mu\}\) that satisfies these commutation relations are spherical tensors.</b>
