            <h1>The Wigner-Eckhart Theorem</h1>
            The Wigner-Eckhart Theorem is as follows:
            \[
                \langle \alpha, JM|\hat T^{(k)}_\mu|\alpha', J'M'\rangle = C^{JM}_{J'M'k\mu}\frac{\langle \alpha J || \hat T^{(k)} || \alpha'J'\rangle}{\sqrt{2J + 1}}
            \]
            Note that on the left hand side of the equation, we have three magnetic quantum numbers, \(M, \mu, M'\) which define how each component is oriented in space.
            The left hand side of the equation places all of the dependence on magnetic numbers on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, and the reduced-matrix element \(\langle \alpha J || \hat T^{(k)} || \alpha'J'\rangle\) is totally independent of magnetic numbers.
            Also note that on its own, \(\hat T^{(k)}_\mu|\alpha', J'M'\rangle\) is not well defined. It is projected onto a <i>specific</i> value with \(\langle \alpha, JM|\).
            <br><br>
            We can demonstrate the Wigner-Eckhart theorem by showing that \(\langle \alpha, JM|\hat T^{(k)}_\mu|\alpha', J'M'\rangle\) follows the same recurrence relations as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
            To do this, we use the commutation relations that we found <a href="sphericalTensors.html">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            Say that we have a state \(\langle \alpha, jm|\hat T^{(k)}_k|\alpha', j'j'\rangle\).
            Here, the magnetic numbers \(M, \mu, M'\) are all as large as possible, given that a magnetic number \(m = -j,\cdots,j\).
