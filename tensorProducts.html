            <h2>Equivalence Classes</h2>
            Given a set \(S = \{a, b, c\}\), the Cartesian product \(S\times S = \{aa, ab, ac, bb, \cdots\}\) is the set of all ordered pairs of elements in \(S\).
            <br><br>
            A <i>relation</i> \(R\) is a subset of \(S\times S\) so that if \((a,b)\in R\), \(a\) is related to \(b\).
            Note that order matters here; relationships depend on order, e.g. if the relationship is "is the wife of", "Grace" could be the wife of "Martin" but "Martin" might not be the wife of "Grace".
            A more specific type of relation is an <i>equivalence relation</i>. 
            Equivalence relation \(R\) with equality operator \(\sim\) has the following properties:
            <ul>
                <li>Reflexive: \(\forall a\in S, (a, a) \in R\), so \(a \sim a\)</li>
                <li>Symmetric: \(\forall a, b | a \sim b \implies b \sim a\)</li>
                <li>Transitive: \(a \sim b, b\sim c \implies a \sim c\) </li>
            </ul>
            Some examples of equivalence relations include the mathematical \(=\), shape congruence, mass equality (induced by Newton's third law), temperature equality (induced by thermal equilibrium), etc. 
            You can even consider use operator spectrum as a criteria for equivalence, which would equate any \(\hat A = \hat A^\dagger\) to \(\hat B = \hat U^{-1}\hat A\hat U\), e.g. \(\hat J_x, \hat J_y\), and \(\hat J_z\).
            <br><br>
            An equivalence class \(\mathcal C_a = [a]\) of set \(S\) is the set of all elements in \(S\), including \(a\), that are equivalent to \(a\) according to \(\sim\).
            In other words, \(\mathcal C_a = \{b \in S | b \sim a\}\).
            It follows that if \(\mathcal C_a\) and \(\mathcal C_b\) have even one element in common, they coincide.
            Either \(\mathcal C_a \cap \mathcal C_b = \varnothing\), or \(\mathcal C_a = \mathcal C_b\).
            Every single element in \(S\) has a class, so \(S = \mathcal C_a \cup \mathcal C_b \cup \mathcal C_c \).
            Further more, you can create a class of the equivalence classes themselves, called the quotient of \(S\) with respect to \(\sim\).
            This is written as \(S/\sim = \{\mathcal C_a, \mathcal C_b, \mathcal C_c\}\).
            <h2>The need for Tensor Products</h2>
            Say that system \(S\) is partitioned into subsystems \(S_I\) and \(S_{II}\) according to some equivalence relation, e.g. state, intrinsic spin, position, etc.
            If subsystem \(S_I\) has Hilbert space \(H_I\) and subsystem \(S_{II}\) has Hilbert space \(H_{II}\), what is the total Hilbert space \(H\) for the entire system \(S\)?
            <br><br>
            If we prepare \(S_I\) in state \(\psi\) and \(S_{II}\) in state \(\phi\), the total state is some \(\Psi(\phi, \psi)\).
            Furthermore, if \(\psi = \psi_1 a_1 + \psi_2 a_2\), we want to be able to also separate the state of the entire system like:
            \[\Psi(\psi_1 a_1 + \psi_2 a_2, \phi) = a_1\Psi(\psi_1, \phi) + a_2 \Psi(\psi_2, \phi)\]
            and if \(\phi = \phi_1 b_1 + \phi_2 b_2\), we want to be able to separate the state of the entire system like:
            \[\Psi(\psi, \phi_1 b_1 + \phi_2 b_2) = b_1\Psi(\psi, \phi_1) + b_2 \Psi(\psi, \phi_2)\]
            This allows us to operate on one subsystem while keeping the other constant.
            Essentially this means that \(\Psi\) has to be bilinear.
            This constraint of bilinearity means (apparently) that there is only one solution: \(H = H_1 \otimes H_{II}\), or that the total Hilbert space is the tensor product between \(H_1\) and \(H_{II}\).
            <br><br>
            Say that we have two vector spaces (tensor products are for all vector spaces, not just Hilbert spaces) \(V_I = \text{span}\{1, x, x^2\}\) and \(V_{II} = \text{span}\{1, y\}\), where an element \(f(x) \in V_I = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2\) and an element \(g(y) \in V_{II} = b_0 + b_1 y\).
            One may be tempted to say that the subset \(M = \{f(x)g(y) | f \in V_I, g \in V_{II}\}\) is a good attempt at combining the two vector spaces, since it yields a \(3 \times 2\)-dimensional vector space.
            However, the diadic product \(f(x)g(y)\):
            \[f(x)g(y) = a_0b_0 + a_0 b_1 y + a_1 b_0 x + a_1 b_1 xy + a_2 b_0 x^2 + a_2 b_1 x^2 y\]
            can never yield the result \(x\cdot 1 + 1 \cdot y\), even though \(x\) is a perfectly valid vector in \(V_I\) and \(y\) is a perfectly valid vector in \(V_{II}\).
            This means that \(M\) isn't even closed under addition and is not a vector space, nor is it bilinear.
            <br><br>
            If we instead tale all linear combinations of these diadic products: \(V = \{\sum_{i=0}^2\sum_{j=0}^1 x^i Y_j c_{ij}\}\), we can indeed get the result  \(x\cdot 1 + 1 \cdot y\).
            This is a 6-dimensional vector space and is the result of the tensor product between vector spaces \(V_I\) and \(V_{II}\).
            <br><br>
            Note that a state \(x\cdot 1 + 1 \cdot y\) indicates that the overall state is a combination of <i>two possible states</i>: 1) that \(f(x) = x\) <i>and</i> \(g(y) = 1\) <b>OR</b> 2) that \(f(x) = 1\) <i>and</i> \(g(y) = y\).
            It is impossible to represent this particular total state as just a single possible state for each subsystem, it can only be described as a <i>linear combination</i> of possible total states.
            Hence tensor products naturally induce the concept of entanglement.
